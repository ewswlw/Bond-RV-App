# Topic: Strategy Extractor (XBBG)

## When to Use

- Choose this template whenever you need an agent prompt tailored to Bloomberg xbbg workflows and the research already assumes Bloomberg field availability.
- Use it to spin up extraction tasks for multi-asset or cross-sectional strategies where precise ticker mapping, field selection, and xbbg query scaffolding are critical.
- Apply it when migrating a free-API prototype to Bloomberg infrastructure so you can capture gaps, premium-field substitutions, and implementation caveats explicitly.
- Reference it during runbooks that involve validating Bloomberg limitations (e.g., intraday coverage, regional datasets) before coding.
- If a project must stay vendor-neutral, fall back to the free-API extractor instead; otherwise treat this as the authoritative xbbg-focused specification.
