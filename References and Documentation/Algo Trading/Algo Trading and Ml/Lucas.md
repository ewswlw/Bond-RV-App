# Lucas Strategy Building Framework: Elite Expert Consultation System

## When to Use

- Use this framework when you are architecting a complete systematic strategy from first principles and need a disciplined, gate-based process from hypothesis to documentation.
- Apply it after you have a core market thesis but before you commit significant engineering resources—the seven steps help you verify the edge, code integrity, and risk controls.
- Reference it while mentoring collaborators; the mandatory input blocks ensure everyone defines objectives, hypotheses, and validation standards before executing analysis.
- Consult it for remediation when an existing strategy underperforms; the pass gates pinpoint whether hypothesis, testing, or recordkeeping broke down.
- Shift to narrower guides (e.g., validation or performance analysis) only after this lifecycle is satisfied; otherwise treat Lucas as the canonical build blueprint.

## Core Strategy Building Framework

### 🎯 **The Process I Wish I Had Years Ago**

**A comprehensive 7-step systematic approach to building robust trading strategies:**

---

## Step 1: Find the Market's Natural Tendency

### **What:** Formulate a clear, falsifiable hypothesis about market behavior
### **Why:** Foundation for all subsequent analysis and strategy development
### **How:** 
- Identify specific market inefficiencies or behavioral patterns
- Formulate testable hypotheses (mean reversion vs. breakout)
- Define market character and natural tendencies
- Establish clear directional bias (long vs. short)

### **Pass Gate:** Clear, testable hypothesis that can be systematically validated

---

## Step 2: Raw Edge Test (No SL, No PT)

### **What:** Isolate the signal without risk controls
### **Why:** Validate the core market hypothesis before adding complexity
### **How:**
- Run simple backtest with entry signals only
- Look for gentle positive slope in performance
- Validate that the core signal has predictive power
- Measure raw edge without risk management interference

### **Pass Gate:** Consistent positive slope with reasonable statistical significance

---

## Step 3: Code & Logic Sanity Check

### **What:** Review code line by line for logical consistency
### **Why:** Ensure implementation matches hypothesis and market character
### **How:**
- Review every line of code for logical consistency
- Verify that implementation matches the original hypothesis
- Ensure parameters are minimal and economically justified
- Validate market character assumptions

### **Pass Gate:** Code logic perfectly matches hypothesis with minimal parameters

---

## Step 4: Verification

### **What:** Confirm results with external validation
### **Why:** Ensure reproducibility and accuracy across different platforms
### **How:**
- Port strategy to external backtester if using internal system
- Run manual backtest for verification
- Aim for 3-5% match on key statistics
- Document any discrepancies and their causes

### **Pass Gate:** Results match within 3-5% across different backtesting platforms

---

## Step 5: Add a Catastrophic Stop (from MAE)

### **What:** Set stop loss based on Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)
### **Why:** Remove extreme outliers while preserving the raw edge
### **How:**
- Calculate MAE from historical trades
- Set stop loss to remove catastrophic outliers
- Preserve the core signal strength
- Maintain risk-reward profile

### **Pass Gate:** Catastrophic stop removes outliers without destroying edge

---

## Step 6: Minimal Optimization (Only 2 Knobs)

### **What:** Optimize only two critical variables
### **Why:** Avoid overfitting while improving performance
### **How:**
- Select only two variables for optimization (e.g., stop loss size)
- Use coarse steps and wide ranges
- Look for stability bands rather than precise peaks
- Focus on robustness over maximum performance

### **Pass Gate:** Stable optimization results across parameter ranges

---

## Step 7: Recordkeeping (Make it Idiot-Proof)

### **What:** Document everything comprehensively
### **Why:** Ensure reproducibility and future reference
### **How:**
- Create comprehensive strategy book
- Document all screenshots and analysis
- Save clean, commented code
- Record complete workspace and environment
- Run 2,000 Monte Carlo simulations
- Confirm worst-case loss scenarios

### **Pass Gate:** Complete documentation with Monte Carlo validation

---

## Advanced Strategy Concepts

### 📊 **Calmar Ratio Validation: The Monkey Test**

**Purpose:** Test strategy performance against random-entry benchmark

#### **How to Run the Monkey Test:**
1. **Generate N Simulations:** Create simulations with random entries but identical exit/stop-loss/take-profit/holding rules
2. **Compute Calmar Ratios:** Calculate Calmar ratios for the null distribution
3. **Locate Strategy Performance:** Find your strategy's Calmar within the distribution
4. **Validate Edge:** Aim for 95th-99th percentile for non-random edge

#### **Why It's Useful:**
- Quick sanity check for strategy validity
- Calibrates expectations against "fat monkey" performance
- Provides statistical significance for strategy edge

### 🚨 **Hidden Risk of Unbounded Data**

**Problem:** Most financial time series are unbounded (long-term trends, regime shifts, structural breaks)

**Consequences:**
- Statistical drift in model performance
- Strategies collapsing in live trading
- Models memorizing noise instead of market behavior

**Solution:**
- Apply transformations (differencing, volatility scaling, log returns)
- Achieve stable distribution characteristics
- Focus on market behavior patterns, not noise

### 🎯 **What I Do Instead of Default Indicators**

**Approach:** Hunt underserved metrics that reflect real market behavior

#### **Strategy:**
- Build robust statistics-based signals
- Test feature stability across assets and regimes
- Align features with clear, testable decision rules
- Focus on unique, well-designed inputs

#### **Result:** Better out-of-sample survival and performance

### 🎯 **The Triple Barrier Method**

**Purpose:** Realistic trade labeling based on three events

#### **Method:**
- **Scale Target:** Profit target reached
- **Stop Loss:** Risk limit breached
- **Time Limit:** Maximum holding period exceeded

#### **Benefits:**
- More realistic trade labels
- Cleaner training data
- Better backtest logic

### ⚠️ **Data Snooping and Look-Ahead Bias Prevention**

**Common Issues:**
- Unintentional use of future data
- Excessive testing leading to false positives
- End-of-day close for future volatility calculations

**The Fix:**
- Log number of ideas/variants evaluated
- Apply multiple testing adjustments
- Maintain strict temporal integrity
- Remember: Live trading reveals the truth

### 🎯 **Focused Model Objectives**

**Problem:** Asking one model to predict everything at once (e.g., daily % returns)

**Why It Fails:**
- Too noisy and complex
- Multiple competing objectives
- Poor signal-to-noise ratio

**Better Approach:**
- Decompose into focused objectives:
  - Volatility estimation
  - Trend direction
  - Trend exhaustion
- Simple, well-defined problems reduce complexity

### 📈 **Useful Non-Linear Transformations**

**Principle:** Not all financial relationships are linear

#### **Examples:**
- **Logit-Maps:** Bounding values within specific ranges
- **Box-Cox:** Stabilizing variance and skewness
- **Splines:** Capturing non-linear patterns

### 🔍 **The Ergodicity Coefficient: Detecting Hidden Market Regimes**

**Purpose:** Detect when markets are not normally distributed

#### **Concept:**
- Markets can cluster into different modes
- EC combines skewness and kurtosis into single measure

#### **Interpretation:**
- **EC < 0.35:** Unimodal, stable regime
- **EC > 0.35:** Bimodal/multimodal distribution with multiple coexisting regimes

### ⏰ **Dynamic Horizon Adaptation**

**Problem:** Fixed horizons introduce structural bias

**Issues:**
- Market events don't follow fixed intervals
- Volatility clusters affect timing
- Small quick moves treated same as slow drifts

**Solution:**
- Adapt horizons dynamically based on volatility
- Use barrier-based targets
- Align with real trading conditions

---

## Red Flags: Stop and Rethink

### 🚨 **Critical Warning Signs:**

- **Too many parameters** for tiny gains
- **Logic contradicting** market tendency
- **Performance collapsing** with minor filter changes
- **PnL not matching** expectations
- **High portfolio correlation**
- **Monte Carlo failing** breach limits
- **Overfitting indicators** present

---

## Position Sizing: The Underestimated Edge

### 💰 **Key Principles:**

- **Fixed Risk per Trade:** Consistent risk allocation
- **Volatility Targeting:** Size based on market volatility
- **Conviction-Weighted Sizing:** Larger positions for higher conviction
- **Fractional Kelly:** Optimal position sizing mathematics
- **Drawdown-Responsive Sizing:** Reduce size during drawdowns
- **Portfolio Constraints:** Maintain diversification limits

### 🎯 **Mantra:** Entry + Disciplined Sizing + Risk Controls = Durable Performance

---

## Advanced Feature Engineering

### 🎯 **Why Raw Future Returns Make Poor Targets**

**Problem:** Raw future returns are close to white noise with low signal-to-noise

**Better Approach:** Predict directional derivatives:
- **Volatility:** More persistent than returns
- **Skew:** Market state indicators
- **Market States:** Regime identification

### 🛡️ **Building Features Robust to Regime Shifts**

**Problem:** Features collapsing in different market regimes

**Solutions:**
- **Normalize by Volatility:** Scale features by market volatility
- **Use Relative Measures:** Focus on relative performance
- **Focus on Structural Properties:** Market structure over price
- **Test Feature Stability:** Across bull, bear, and sideways markets

**Definition:** A robust feature maintains meaning even when the market changes

### 🧭 **Temporal Stability of Features**

**Principle:** A feature is only useful if its meaning remains consistent over time. If its distribution, scale, or predictive relationship drifts materially, it degrades into noise.

**Common causes of instability:**
- Structural breaks in markets
- Changes in volatility regimes
- Over-normalization on short windows

**What to do:**
- Test feature stability across multiple periods, assets, and regimes (bull, bear, sideways)
- Track distributional diagnostics over time (mean, variance, skew, kurtosis) and predictive lift stability
- Use rolling/expanding estimates with adequate half-lives; avoid overly short normalization windows
- Condition features on state variables (e.g., volatility, momentum) when appropriate to counter regime shifts
- Prefer relative/scale-free formulations and volatility-normalized features

**Cross-links:** See also "Hidden Risk of Unbounded Data" for distributional stabilization and "Dynamic Horizon Adaptation" for horizon alignment.
