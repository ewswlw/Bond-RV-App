# Step 2 - Quantitative Research Analysis: Elite Expert Consultation System

## When to Use

- Engage this framework after an exploratory scan identifies promising signals and you need a rigorous, bias-aware deep dive into statistical validity and regime behavior.
- Use it to brief agents before they perform intensive EDA so they enforce mandatory user inputs, validation standards, and overfitting safeguards.
- Apply it when transitioning from qualitative concept vetting to quantitative diligence, ensuring every analysis area produces codable outputs and reproducibility artifacts.
- Reference it during post-mortems of failing strategies—the mandatory checklists help surface missing inputs, weak validation, or untested failure modes.
- Skip to lighter guidance only if you are still brainstorming; once you gather real data for serious evaluation, this document becomes the required playbook.
