# Generate 20 Trading Strategy Ideas - Elite Expert Consultation System

## When to Use

- Use this document as the kickoff workflow when you need a large batch of differentiated strategy hypotheses grounded in a single core concept.
- Invoke it after defining strategic constraints so the system can enforce mandatory input validation and prevent low-quality brainstorming.
- Apply it when coaching agents to ideate in a disciplined, first-principles manner that balances creativity with implementation realism.
- Reference it during workshops or collaborative ideation sessions; the optional constraint blocks help teams converge on viable markets, timeframes, and data sources.
- If you already narrowed down to one or two vetted strategies, shift to the Strategy Improver or validation guides instead; otherwise treat this ideation protocol as the canonical starting point.

## FIRST PRINCIPLES THINKING METHODOLOGY

**Before generating ideas, the system will:**

### Phase 1: Precision Clarification Engine
**Activation Criteria:** Complex strategy development requiring deep understanding

**Clarification Protocol:**
1. **Concept Decomposition:** Break the core concept into fundamental components
   - What does this concept really measure or reflect?
   - What are the underlying market forces?
   - What behavioral or structural anomalies does it exploit?

2. **Edge Identification:** Identify the exploitable edge
   - Why would this edge persist?
   - What market participants are missing this?
   - What structural barriers prevent arbitrage?

3. **Implementation Constraints:** Map practical limitations
   - Data requirements and availability
   - Computational complexity
   - Market access and execution constraints

### Phase 2: Elite Perspective Analysis
**Channeling Top 0.1% Quant Mindset:**

**Strategic Analysis:**
- Apply first-principles thinking to market structure
- Consider unconventional approaches beyond traditional indicators
- Integrate cross-domain insights from behavioral finance, microstructure, and macroeconomics

### Phase 3: Paradigm Challenge Engine
**Breaking Conventional Thinking:**

**Innovation Framework:**
- Challenge fundamental assumptions about market efficiency
- Explore "impossible" solutions that conventional wisdom dismisses
- Reframe problems from multiple market participant perspectives

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE: 20 UNIQUE STRATEGY IDEAS

**Each strategy will follow this exact format:**

### Strategy #[X]: [Catchy Descriptive Name]

**Setup Logic:** 
- [1-2 sentence explanation using MAXIMUM 3 conditions]
- Focus on the core concept application
- Avoid generic setups like "RSI < 30" unless deeply contextualized

**Best Markets:** 
- [Specific markets where this strategy would excel]
- Consider liquidity, volatility, and structural characteristics

**Type of Strategy:** 
- [e.g., trend-following, mean-reversion, breakout, momentum, contrarian, arbitrage]

**Recommended Timeframe:** 
- [Suggested timeframe if not provided in constraints]

**First Principles Note:** 
- [What specific edge or market belief this setup explores]
- Explain the underlying market mechanism

**Testing Requirements:** 
- Data needed: [Specific data requirements]
- Minimum trades: [Realistic trade count expectations]
- Constraints: [Any implementation limitations]

**Internal Ratings (Scale 0-10):**
- **Plausibility:** [How likely this edge exists and persists]
- **Testability:** [How easily this can be backtested and validated]  
- **Creativity:** [How original and non-obvious this approach is]

## QUALITY ASSURANCE PROTOCOL

**Before finalizing the 20 ideas, the system will validate:**

1. **Uniqueness Check:** Each idea must be distinct and non-overlapping
2. **Testability Validation:** All ideas must be implementable by a solo trader
3. **Edge Persistence:** Each strategy explores a different market inefficiency
4. **Practical Implementation:** All ideas use standard data and tools

**Final Validation Question:**
*"Would these 20 ideas provide breakthrough-level value to a quant researcher facing this exact core concept challenge? If not, which additional perspectives should be explored?"*

---

## SYSTEM EXECUTION FLOW

### Step 1: Input Validation
**CRITICAL:** System will refuse to proceed without:
- Core Concept field completed (no blanks allowed)
- Validation that the concept is specific and actionable

### Step 2: Constraint Processing  
- Process all optional constraints provided by user
- Identify any conflicts or limitations

### Step 3: First Principles Analysis
- Decompose the core concept using the methodology above
- Identify the fundamental market mechanisms to exploit

### Step 4: Strategy Generation
- Generate 20 unique, testable strategies following the exact format
- Ensure each strategy explores a different aspect of the core concept

### Step 5: Quality Validation
- Verify uniqueness, testability, and practical implementation
- Provide final recommendations and next steps
