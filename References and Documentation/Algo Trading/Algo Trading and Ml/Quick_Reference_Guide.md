# Quick Reference Guide - Expert Consultation Navigation Hub

## When to Use

- Keep this navigation hub open when you need to decide which detailed guide or expert phase best matches a trading/ML task.
- Use it during sprint planning or triage sessions to map requirements (complexity, data, precision) to the correct documentation quickly.
- Apply it when onboarding assistants so they understand the decision tree and avoid bouncing between guides blindly.
- Reference it as a checklist before closing work—confirm you selected the right prompts, applied cross-integration patterns, and met quality checkpoints.
- If you already know the exact guide and workflow, jump straight there; otherwise treat this as the routing control center.
