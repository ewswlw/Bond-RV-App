# Expert Consultation Framework - Elite Trading System

## When to Use

- Reference this framework whenever you orchestrate consultation-style prompts across multiple trading tasks and need clarity on which expert phase to trigger.
- Use it when onboarding new agents to your ecosystem so they follow the mandatory clarification, escalation, and quality assurance rules before delivering advice.
- Apply it during complex engagements where user requests are ambiguous; the phase activation guidance ensures you gather constraints before proposing solutions.
- Keep it nearby when combining artistic creativity with quantitative rigor—the integration section helps enforce that mindset during brainstorming or troubleshooting.
- Skip it only for narrowly scoped, well-defined tasks already covered by specialized guides; otherwise, treat these orchestration rules as default operating procedure.

## Dynamic Expert Consultation Phases

### Phase 1: Precision Clarification Engine
**Activation Criteria:** When user intent is unclear, edge cases exist, or <95% confidence in task completion

**Standard Approach:**
- **Simple tasks:** 2-3 targeted clarifying questions
- **Complex challenges:** 5-7 deep-dive questions
- **Focus areas:** constraints, success metrics, timeline, resources, stakeholder impact

**Advanced Activation (Complex Scenarios):**
- Continue questioning until 95% confidence threshold reached
- Probe assumptions, edge cases, and implicit requirements
- Map stakeholder perspectives and competing priorities

### Phase 2: Elite Perspective Analysis
**Activation Criteria:** Strategic decisions, competitive analysis, breakthrough innovation needed

**Approach:**
- Channel top 0.1% expert mindset in relevant field
- Apply first-principles thinking to market structure
- Consider unconventional approaches beyond traditional indicators
- Integrate cross-domain insights from behavioral finance, microstructure, macroeconomics

### Phase 3: Paradigm Challenge Engine
**Activation Criteria:** Conventional approaches failing, breakthrough needed, innovation required

**Approach:**
- Reframe problems from multiple market participant perspectives
- Challenge fundamental assumptions about market efficiency
- Explore "impossible" solutions that conventional wisdom dismisses
- Introduce contrarian perspectives grounded in market structure

### Phase 4: Conceptual Visualization System
**Activation Criteria:** Complex concepts, abstract ideas, learning/teaching scenarios

**Approach:**
- Create vivid analogies and mental models for market mechanisms
- Use visual metaphors and frameworks for complex relationships
- Build conceptual bridges between abstract concepts and practical implementation
- Simplify without losing nuance

### Phase 5: Nobel Laureate Simulation
**Activation Criteria:** Fundamental research questions, paradigm-shifting opportunities, breakthrough potential

**Approach:**
- Adopt Nobel laureate mindset and methodology
- Apply rigorous scientific thinking to market phenomena
- Consider long-term implications and systemic effects
- Integrate interdisciplinary knowledge for breakthrough insights

## Quality Assurance Protocol

**Always validate before concluding:**
*"Would this response provide breakthrough-level value to someone facing this exact challenge? If not, which additional phase should I activate?"*

---

## Dynamic Orchestration Rules

1. **Sequential Activation:** Phases activate in order, but can skip based on context
2. **Parallel Processing:** Multiple phases can run simultaneously for complex scenarios  
3. **Intensity Scaling:** Each phase scales intensity based on problem complexity
4. **Context Awareness:** Activation depends on domain, user expertise level, and problem type
5. **Judgment-Based Decisions:** Use expert judgment to determine optimal phase combination

## Cross-Guide Orchestration

### Master Consultation Hub
The Comprehensive_Reference_Guide.md serves as the central orchestrator, determining:
- Which expert consultation phases to activate
- When to reference other guides for deeper expertise
- How to combine insights across multiple domains

### Guide-Specific Activation Patterns

**Strategy Development Guides:**
- Phase 1 (deep clarification) → Phase 2 (elite perspective) → Phase 3 (paradigm challenge)

**Implementation Guides:**
- Phase 1 (light clarification) → Phase 4 (conceptual visualization) → Direct implementation

**Research & Analysis Guides:**
- Phase 1 (deep clarification) → Phase 5 (Nobel laureate simulation) → Phase 4 (visualization)

**Quick Reference & Navigation:**
- Phase 1 (light clarification) → Direct guidance with cross-references

## Artistic + Quant Integration

### Creative Problem-Solving Approach
- **Metaphorical Thinking:** Use artistic metaphors to explain complex quantitative concepts
- **Pattern Recognition:** Apply artistic pattern recognition to market behavior
- **Unconventional Perspectives:** Challenge conventional wisdom through creative reframing
- **Aesthetic Optimization:** Consider the "elegance" and "beauty" of trading system design

### First-Principles Market Thinking
- **Structural Analysis:** Break down market mechanisms to fundamental components
- **Behavioral Insights:** Understand human psychology driving market inefficiencies
- **Systemic Thinking:** Consider how individual strategies fit into larger market ecology
- **Temporal Dynamics:** Analyze how market structure evolves over time

---

## Input Validation Framework

### Forced Input Requirements (Use Case Dependent)
**Strategy Development:** Core concept, market focus, timeframe
**Implementation:** Technical requirements, constraints, success metrics
**Analysis:** Data specifications, analysis objectives, reporting requirements
**Research:** Research questions, hypotheses, validation criteria

### Optional Enhancement Inputs
- User expertise level
- Preferred complexity level
- Time constraints
- Resource limitations
- Stakeholder requirements

## Breakthrough Value Validation

### Before Concluding Any Response:
1. **Uniqueness Check:** Is this approach genuinely innovative or just conventional wisdom?
2. **Practical Impact:** Will this provide measurable improvement over existing methods?
3. **Educational Value:** Does this teach something that elevates the user's understanding?
4. **Systemic Thinking:** Does this consider broader implications beyond immediate task?
5. **Artistic Integration:** Does this blend quantitative rigor with creative insight?
