# Book Analysis Notes

## When to Use

- Consult this file when scoping how the two core reference books will be mined for content and converted into structured guides.
- Use it during planning sessions to confirm which topical files already exist and where new summaries should land.
- Reference it when assigning research tasks—it maps each topic to book coverage so workloads can be divided logically.
- Apply it as a checklist after extracting content to ensure every planned section has been captured before moving to drafting.
- Skip it if you are already implementing within a specific topic file; this document serves as the high-level roadmap, not the detailed instructions.

## Book 1: Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading (Stefan Jansen, 2020)
- Total Pages: 821
- Focus: Practical implementation of ML for trading with Python
- Comprehensive coverage from data sources to deployment

## Book 2: Advances in Financial Machine Learning (Marcos López de Prado, 2018)
- Total Pages: 393
- Focus: Advanced theoretical and practical concepts for financial ML
- Emphasis on avoiding common pitfalls in financial ML projects

## Proposed Topic Organization (8-10 files):

Based on initial review, the following topic areas will be covered:

1. **Data Structures and Financial Data Engineering**
   - Financial data types and structures
   - Data bars (time, tick, volume, dollar bars)
   - Feature engineering for financial data
   - Alternative data sources

2. **Labeling Methods and Meta-Labeling**
   - Triple barrier method
   - Fixed-time horizon labeling
   - Meta-labeling approach
   - Quantile-based labeling

3. **Sample Weights and Data Sampling**
   - Sequential bootstrap
   - Sample uniqueness
   - Return attribution
   - Cross-validation for financial data

4. **Feature Importance and Selection**
   - Mean decrease impurity/accuracy
   - Single feature importance
   - Orthogonal features
   - PCA and dimensionality reduction

5. **Backtesting and Strategy Evaluation**
   - Backtesting pitfalls and solutions
   - Walk-forward analysis
   - Combinatorial purged cross-validation
   - Performance metrics and benchmarking

6. **Portfolio Construction and Risk Management**
   - Portfolio optimization techniques
   - Position sizing
   - Risk parity
   - Bet sizing using ML predictions

7. **Machine Learning Models for Trading**
   - Supervised learning (classification/regression)
   - Ensemble methods
   - Deep learning for trading
   - Reinforcement learning

8. **Market Microstructure and High-Frequency Data**
   - Order flow analysis
   - Microstructure features
   - Tick data processing
   - VPIN and other microstructure indicators

9. **Strategy Development and Research Process**
   - Research workflow
   - Strategy backtesting framework
   - Production deployment
   - Monitoring and maintenance

10. **Advanced Topics and Special Considerations**
    - Fractional differentiation
    - Entropy features
    - Structural breaks detection
    - Multi-asset and multi-strategy approaches

## Next Steps:
1. Extract detailed content from both books for each topic
2. Synthesize and organize information
3. Create comprehensive documentation files
