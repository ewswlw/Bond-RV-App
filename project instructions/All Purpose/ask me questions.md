# Clarifying Questions & Best Practices

## Question-Asking Prompts

When tackling complex tasks, use these prompts to ensure clarity:

1. **Confidence Check**: Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully

2. **Expert Perspective**: What would a top 0.1% person in this field think?

3. **Reframing**: Reframe this in a way that challenges how I see the problem

4. **Visual Explanation**: Explain visually using analogies or mental models

5. **Expert Roleplay**: Roleplay as a Nobel laureate solving this problem

6. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Output an overview of every single dimension of my request. Find points of uncertainty. Then, ask me as many clarifying questions as possible
